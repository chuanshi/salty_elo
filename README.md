twitch_dump.py needs a directory vid_dir in order to work properly

latest tesseract-ocr training data is in ocr_training/try2/eng2.traineddata
this part is fairly rigid, and making it more flexible is on TODO
top things TODO to optimize OCR:
1) add/makesureisused eng1.user-words to tessdata directory.  populate with fighter names automatically somehow
2) make the image filter more advanced

possible corrections to matches obtained from challonge:
is DAZZLER actually THE DAZZLER?
is DRAGONCLAW actually DRAGON CLAW?
